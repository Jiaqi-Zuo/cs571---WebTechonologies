            Los Angeles is the City of Dreams and is the heart of southern
            California. It is a vast and varied geographic entity. The city is
            famous for being the home of the rich and famous, Hollywood, the
            main home of major entertainment companies, ethnically diverse, and
            the second-largest city in America.
          </p>
          <p>
            The residents of Los Angeles are called Angelenos. Their lifestyle
            relies on the automobile, idealizes the single-family dwelling, and
            favours informality. With notable exceptions, the skyline is
            primarily horizontal rather than vertical. Los Angeles is a place of
            extraordinary ethnic and racial diversity, owing largely to
            immigration. It is a must visit place and a beautiful vacation
            desination.

            <!--No trip to Los Angeles is complete without a visit to Hollywood, the home of movie studios, many of LA's most popular and historic tourist destinations, and its world-famous namesake boulevard. A larger-than-life symbol of the entertainment business, Hollywood beckons tourists with landmarks like TCL Chinese Theatre and star-studded Walk of Fame. Many tourists come to Hollywood to see all of these things. Because of the importance of Hollywood in the movie industry of the United States, the whole industry is often called "Hollywood", even though not all movies are made in Hollywood.-->

            <!--One of the biggest draws of the Los Angeles area is the beach scene (especially when you've had enough of the traffic). Los Angeles may possibly be the American city with the best overall variety of local beaches. There are a wide range of beaches within the large confines of Los Angeles County, and the county also neighbors miles and miles of other beach cities, spreading both north and south of LA. Families may enjoy large beaches like Santa Monica or Redondo Beach, with a wide range of facilities, retail areas, and amenities, while adventurers may like more secluded beaches like those found in Malibu or Palos Verdes.-->
